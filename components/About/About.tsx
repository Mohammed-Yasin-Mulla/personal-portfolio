          {` My passion for computers began at the age of 8 with a Windows XP
          system that introduced me to the world of flash games like Miniclip. 4
          years and a burned up power supply later, I knew computers and
          electronics is where my interests lay. As a mechanical engineering
          student with varied interests, I spent a lot of time learning a lot
          more about coding and design and taught myself both React.js and
          Fusion360. Today, Iâ€™m a well equipped front end developer who is
          constantly evolving towards being a full stack developer.`}
